Purpose:

It's a machine translation project that converts text from one language to another.
Key Processes:

Data Preparation:

Loads input and output text pairs from datasets.
Preprocesses text (e.g., punctuation removal, standardization).
Splits data into training, validation, and test sets.
Vectorizes text using one-hot encoding, mapping words to numerical representations.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model:

Creates an encoder-decoder architecture using GRU layers.
The encoder processes the input text and generates a context vector.
The decoder generates the output translation step by step, using the context and previously generated words.
Training:

Trains the model on the prepared dataset, optimizing accuracy.
Employs early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Saves the best-performing model during training.
Evaluation:

Evaluates model performance on the test dataset, calculating accuracy.
Translation:

Provides a function to translate new, unseen sentences using the trained model.
Specific Details:

Vocab Size: 13 for input language, 37 for output language.
Sequence Length: 200.
Batch Size: 64.
Latent Dimension: 1024.
Overall, the project successfully builds a machine translation model using RNNs and demonstrates its translation capabilities.
